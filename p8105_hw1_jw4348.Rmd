# Problem 1

Here's a brife description of `early_january_weather` dataset.

* This dataset's _variables_ are **`r ls(early_january_weather)`**.

* The _size_ of the dataset is **`r nrow(early_january_weather)`** rows and **`r ncol(early_january_weather)`** columns.

* The _mean_ of the variable `Temperature` is **`r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp, na.rm = TRUE), digit = 4)`**.

* This is a _scatterplot_ of temperature vs. time in `early_january_weather` dataset

```{r}
hw_plot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
hw_plot
```

* Next is the code chunk to export the scatterplot to my project directory.

```{r}
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf", hw_plot)
```
