# Problem 1

Here’s a brife description of `early_january_weather` dataset.

- This dataset’s *variables* are **day, dewp, hour, humid, month,
  origin, precip, pressure, temp, time_hour, visib, wind_dir, wind_gust,
  wind_speed, year**.

- The *size* of the dataset is **358** rows and **15** columns.

- The *mean* of the variable `Temperature` is **39.5821**.

- This is a *scatterplot* of temperature vs. time in
  `early_january_weather` dataset

``` r
hw_plot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
hw_plot
```

- Next is the code chunk to export the scatterplot to my project
  directory.

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf", hw_plot)
```

# Problem 2

This code chunk should create a dataframe comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
  hw_df = 
    tibble(
      num_sample = (rnorm(10)),
      log_vec = num_sample > 0,
      char_vec = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
      fac_vec = factor(c("Agree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Neutral","Agree", 
                         "Agree","Disagree", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Agree")),
    )
```

Next I will take the *mean* of each variable in my dataframe `hw_df`.

- The *mean* of numeric variable in this data frame is **0.4025**

- The *mean* of logical variables in this data frame is **0.6**

- The *mean* of factor variables in this data frame is **NA**

- The *mean* of character variables in this data frame is **NA**

- After taking the mean of each variables, only **numeric** and
  **logical** variable works, the **factor** and **character** variables
  don’t work

Finally, I will write a code chunk to convert my other types of
variables into numerical one.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw_df,log_vec))
as.numeric(pull(hw_df,char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(hw_df,fac_vec))
```

- After I used `as.numeric` to convert my variables:
  - I got warning messages:
    - **1: In mean.default(pull(hw_df, fac_vec)) : argument is not
      numeric or logical: returning NA**
    - **2: In mean.default(pull(hw_df, char_vec)) :argument is not
      numeric or logical: returning NA**
  - Because we were calculating the mean of the numeric versions of
    factor and character variables, they are not inherently numeric.
  - This do explaining why I got mean for numeric and logical variables
    but not for factor and character variables previously. Because
    numeric and logical variables can be treated as numeric.
